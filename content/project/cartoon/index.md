title: WONDERLAND
summary: This is a brand of laboratory that allows you to experience Alice in Wonderland syndrome. The experience allows the user to empathise with the patient's perspective by experiencing visual effects. Patients can also consult and socialise online through the lab's app. It is also a way to educate the public about Alice in Wonderland, a disease that only a few people suffer from. This kind of patients can also live a very comfortable life, perhaps they see things more interesting or more imaginative.
