title: Water’s Future
summary: This is a speculative design project addressing future resource scarcity. Responding to global land degradation data, it proposes innovative “atmospheric resource utilization”. The fictional “Nephele Station” research facility and its two products - “Nephele Drop” drinking water and “Nephele Mist” hydration system - visualize the potential of aerial resources. Combining data research with future narratives, the work challenges conventional resource paradigms.
